# Oil-spills-detection
it's quite hard to detect oil spills, especially if you have polluted water. In this work I will consider classical computer vision techniques and machine learning with YoloV5 to detect oil spills on the surface of river.

### 1. EDA
Firstly I've made EDA of initial data. I had one mp4 file (30 seconds) of pollutex river, obtained from dron's camera (height of fly is 40-50m)
